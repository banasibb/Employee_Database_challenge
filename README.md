# Employee_Database_challenge
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the Employee Analysis was to leverage PostgreSQL to create a database to analyze six CSV data files containing information about current and former employees of the Pewlett-Hackard company. The output would then be used to assess attributes of the workforce eligible for retirement and participation in the mentorship program. <br />
### Resources
- Data Sources: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv<br />
- Software: pgAdmin 4 (Version 6.12), QuickDBD ([quickdatabasediagrams.com](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/))

<br />Employees eligible for retirement are currently employed with Pewlett-Hackard with a birth date between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Because many employees have been promoted during their tenure with the company, the data had to be narrowed to include only the most recent job title for each employee ID number. These results were then summarized in a breakdown of total employees eligible for retirement by job title.
Part two of the analysis was to compare employees eligible for retirement to the total number of employees eligible for the client's mentorship program. The results should inform senior leadership as to how prepared their current workforce is to train incoming employees in the event of a "silver tsunami."
