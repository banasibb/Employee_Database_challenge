# Employee_Database_challenge
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of the Employee Analysis was to leverage PostgreSQL to create an ERT containing six CSV data files with information about current and former employees of the Pewlett-Hackard company. The output was then be used to assess attributes of the workforce eligible for retirement and participation in the mentorship program. The results will inform senior leadership as to how prepared their current workforce is to train incoming employees in the event of a "silver tsunami." <br />
### Resources
- Data Sources: departments.csv, dept_emp.csv, dept_manager.csv, employees.csv, salaries.csv, titles.csv<br />
- Software: pgAdmin 4 (Version 6.12), QuickDBD ([quickdatabasediagrams.com](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/))<br /><br />
The following database diagram was used to support the design of the ERT developed for this challenge:

## Results
The SQL for this challenge is contained in the file [Employee_Database_challenge.sql](https://github.com/banasibb/Employee_Database_challenge/blob/65e4ab884626028fc264b62e5b8b573ab8b25fa5/Employee_Challenge.sql). 
### Retirement Titles
Using the ERD you created in this module as a reference and your knowledge of SQL queries, create a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. 
 ```
SELECT e.emp_no,
	e.first_name,
	e.last_name,
	t.title,
	t.from_date,
	t.to_date
INTO retirement_titles
FROM employees as e
INNER JOIN titles AS t
ON (e.emp_no = t.emp_no)
WHERE (e.birth_date BETWEEN '1952-01-01' AND '1955-12-31')
ORDER BY e.emp_no;
  ```
The output of this analysis is here: [retirement_titles.csv](https://github.com/banasibb/Employee_Database_challenge/blob/12682cfdb9abefb968f84cf8ed86310e71967639/retirement_titles.csv)<br />

### Unique Titles
Because some employees may have multiple titles in the database—for example, due to promotions—you’ll need to use the DISTINCT ON statement to create a table that contains the most recent title of each employee.
```
SELECT DISTINCT ON (rt.emp_no)
	rt.emp_no,
	rt.first_name,
	rt.last_name,
	rt.title
INTO unique_titles
FROM retirement_titles as rt
LEFT JOIN dept_emp as de
ON (rt.emp_no = de.emp_no)
WHERE (de.to_date = '9999-01-01')
ORDER BY rt.emp_no, de.to_date DESC;
  ```
The output of this analysis is here: [unique_titles.csv](https://github.com/banasibb/Employee_Database_challenge/blob/746080a7c0693d1dff7dbcb2fa7e9605f37afc70/unique_titles.csv)<br />

### Retiring Titles
Then, use the COUNT() function to create a table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title. Finally, because we want to include only current employees in our analysis, be sure to exclude those employees who have already left the company.
 ```
    SELECT COUNT (ut.emp_no),
	ut.title
--INTO retiring_titles
FROM retirement_titles as rt
INNER JOIN unique_titles as ut
ON (rt.emp_no = ut.emp_no)
WHERE (rt.to_date = '9999-01-01')
GROUP BY ut.title
ORDER BY COUNT(ut.emp_no) DESC;
  ```
The output of this analysis is here: [retiring_titles.csv](https://github.com/banasibb/Employee_Database_challenge/blob/746080a7c0693d1dff7dbcb2fa7e9605f37afc70/retiring_titles.csv)<br />

### Mentorship Eligibility
Create a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.
```
SELECT DISTINCT ON (e.emp_no)
	e.emp_no,
	e.first_name,
	e.last_name,
	e.birth_date,
	de.from_date,
	de.to_date,
	ti.title
INTO mentorship_eligibility
FROM employees as e
INNER JOIN dept_emp as de
ON e.emp_no=de.emp_no
INNER JOIN titles as ti
ON de.emp_no=ti.emp_no
WHERE (de.to_date = '9999-01-01')
	AND (e.birth_date BETWEEN '1965-01-01' AND '1965-12-31')
ORDER BY e.emp_no;
  ```
The output of this analysis is contained here: [mentorship_eligibility.csv](https://github.com/banasibb/Employee_Database_challenge/blob/746080a7c0693d1dff7dbcb2fa7e9605f37afc70/mentorship_eligibility.csv)<br />

## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
